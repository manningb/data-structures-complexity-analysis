    "## 2. Poison Puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "An evil king has n bottles of wine, and a spy has just poisoned one of them. Unfortunately, they do not know which one it is. The poison is very deadly; just one drop diluted even a billion to one will still kill. Even so, it takes a full month for the poison to take effect. Design a scheme for determining exactly which one of the wine bottles was poisoned in just one monthâ€™s time while expending $\\mathcal{O}(log(n))$ taste testers. Can you write code to prove the scheme?"
